In this exercise, you'll calculate prevalence, one of the basic epidemiologic measures of disease burden.

## Prevalence

```yaml
type: FullCodeSlide
key: 79272ed3d3
```

`@part1`
In this example, assume we have detected 100 cases of a disease in a population of 500,000. 

```
# Assign the value 100 to a variable called "cases".
cases <- 100

# Similarly, assign a variable for population at risk.
population <- 500000

# For large numbers, it can be clearer to use scientific notation.
population <- 5 * 10^5

# Finally, calculate the proportion of cases in the population.
prevalence <- cases / population

```

- Make a note of the operators we will use in R:  +, -, *, /, ^
- The assignment operator: <- 
- And the comment character: #
