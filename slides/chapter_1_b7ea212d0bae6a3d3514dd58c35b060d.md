In this exercise, you'll calculate prevalence, one of the basic epidemiologic measures of disease burden.

## Prevalence

```yaml
type: FullCodeSlide
key: 79272ed3d3
```

`@part1`
In this example, assume we have detected 100 cases of a disease in a population of 500,000. 

```
# Assign the value 100 to a variable called "cases".
cases <- 100

# Similarly, assign a variable for population at risk.
population <- 500000

# For large numbers, it can be clearer to use scientific notation.
population <- 5 * 10^5

# Finally, calculate the proportion of cases in the population.
prevalence <- cases / population

```

- Notice the operators we will use in R:  +, -, *, /, ^
- The assignment operator: <- 
- And the comment character: #

## Prevalence estimates

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: b12f495229
```

`@part1`
- 37% of adults in the US are obese
- 16% of Oregonians smoke tobacco
- 30 per 10,000 Americans has schizophrenia

`@part2`





`@script`
You have probably heard many estimates of prevalence. For example it is estimated that 37% of adults in the US are obese and 16% of Oregonians smoke tobacco. For common conditions, we put prevalence in terms of percent. When a condition is rare, we use per 10 or 100 thousand. For example, 30 per 10,000 Americans has schizophrenia.
